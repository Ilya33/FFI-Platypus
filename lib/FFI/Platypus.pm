=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following is a (probably incomplete) list of environment variables
recognized by L<FFI::Platypus>:

=over 4

=item C<FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_ALLOCA>

L<FFI::Platypus> may use the non standard and sometimes controversial C<alloca>
function to allocate very small amounts of memory during ffi calls.  I
test whether or not it works on your platform during build, and use it in
moderation, so I believe it to be safe.  You may turn it off by setting
this environment variable to C<0> when you run C<Build.PL>.

=item C<FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_SYSTEM_FFI>

If your system does not provide C<libffi>, then L<FFI::Platypus> will attempt
to build it from bundled source.  Setting this environment variable to C<0>
will skip the check for a system C<libffi> and build it from source regardless.

=item C<FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_VERBOSE>

Be more verbose to stdout during the configuration / build step.  All
of this verbosity may be viewed in the C<build.log>, but you may want
to see it spew as it happens.

=item C<FFI_PLATYPUS_TEST_LIBARCHIVE>

Full path to C<libarchive.so> or C<archive.dll> used optionally during test.

=back

=head1 BUNDLED SOFTWARE

This distribution comes with this bundled software:

=over 4

=item L<libffi>

If your system provides a version of C<libffi> that can be guessed or
discovered using C<pkg-config> or L<PkgConfig>, then it will be used.

If not, then a bundled version of libffi will be used.

This is only used during the build process and only if the C<Build.PL>
cannot find libffi either by guessing or by using the system pkg-config.

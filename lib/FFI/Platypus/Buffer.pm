# ABSTRACT: Convert scalars to C buffers
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use FFI::Platypus::Buffer;
 my($pointer, $size) = scalar_to_buffer $scalar;
 my $scalar2 = buffer_to_scallar $pointer, $size;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A common pattern in C is to pass a "buffer" or region of memory into
a function with a pair of arguments, an opaque pointer and the size
of the memory region.  In Perl the equivalent structure is a scalar
containing a string of bytes.  This module provides portable functions
for converting a Perl string or scalar into a buffer and back.

These functions are implemented using L<pack|perlfunc#pack> and
L<unpack|perlfunc#unpack> so they should be relatively fast.

Both functions are exported by default, but you can explicitly export
one or neither if you so choose.

Now for the history lesson.  These functions were originally provided
as part of the L<FFI::Util> module.  The intent of L<FFI::Platypus>
was to provide a C<libffi> interface with custom types as a core
feature that would render most of L<FFI::Util> obsolete.  For the most
part L<FFI::Platypus> has done this, except it isn't currently possible
to implement buffers with custom types YET, so I am including this
module as part of L<FFI::Platypus> so that real FFI modules can be
written on CPAN right away.  Just keep in mind that a better way
may eventually find its way into the core of L<FFI::Platypus>.

  ? 'Q'
  : 'L!';

=head2 scalar_to_buffer

 my($pointer, $size) = scalar_to_buffer $scalar;

Convert a string scalar into a buffer.  Returned in order are a pointer
to the start of the string scalar's memory region and the size of the
region.  This function DOES NOT copy any memory, so it is fast, but you
have to be careful, especially if you are passing it into C code that
might modify it, or keep it past when the original string scalar falls
out of scope.

=cut

sub scalar_to_buffer ($)
{
  (unpack(_incantation, pack 'P', $_[0]), do { use bytes; length $_[0] });
}

=head2 buffer_to_scalar

 my $scalar = buffer_to_scalar $pointer, $size;

Convert the buffer region defined by the pointer and size into a string
scalar.  For this operation, the buffer region is copied into the new
string scalar, so it may be slow if you use it a lot, especially for large
regions of memory.  You do not, however, have to worry if the original
region of memory is later modified by C code.

{
  unpack 'P'.$_[1], pack _incantation, defined $_[0] ? $_[0] : 0;

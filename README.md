# BUNDLED SOFTWARE

This distribution comes with this bundled software:

- [PkgConfig](https://metacpan.org/pod/PkgConfig)

    Currently maintained by Graham Ollis <plicease@cpan.org>.
    This is only used during the build process and only if the `Build.PL`
    cannot find libffi either by guessing or by using the system pkg-config.

# FFI::Platypus

Kinda like gluing a duckbill to an adorable mammal

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following is a (probably incomplete) list of environment variables
recognized by [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus):

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_ALLOCA`

    [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus) may use the non standard and sometimes controversial `alloca`
    function to allocate very small amounts of memory during ffi calls.  I
    test whether or not it works on your platform during build, and use it in
    moderation, so I believe it to be safe.  You may turn it off by setting
    this environment variable to `0` when you run `Build.PL`.

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_CFLAGS`

    Extra c flags to include during the build of [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus).  Useful for
    including debug flags like `-g3`.

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_LDFLAGS`

    Extra linker flags to include during the build of [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus).

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_REMOVE_OPT`

    If true then [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus) will attempt to remove optimization c flags
    during the build step.  Normally the same flags used in building Perl
    are used by default.  This option may be helpful when debugging the XS code,
    but it is also quite simplistic and may break in some environments.

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_SYSTEM_FFI`

    If your system does not provide `libffi`, then [FFI::Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus) will attempt
    to build it from bundled source.  Setting this environment variable to `0`
    will skip the check for a system `libffi` and build it from source regardless.

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_BUILD_VERBOSE`

    Be more verbose to stdout during the configuration / build step.  All
    of this verbosity may be viewed in the `build.log`, but you may want
    to see it spew as it happens.

- `FFI_PLATYPUS_TEST_LIBARCHIVE`

    Full path to `libarchive.so` or `archive.dll` used optionally during test.

# BUNDLED SOFTWARE

This distribution comes with this bundled software:

- [libffi](https://metacpan.org/pod/libffi)

    If your system provides a version of `libffi` that can be guessed or
    discovered using `pkg-config` or [PkgConfig](https://metacpan.org/pod/PkgConfig), then it will be used.

    If not, then a bundled version of libffi will be used.

- [PkgConfig](https://metacpan.org/pod/PkgConfig)

    Currently maintained by Graham Ollis <plicease@cpan.org>.
    This is only used during the build process and only if the `Build.PL`
    cannot find libffi either by guessing or by using the system pkg-config.

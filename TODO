Hi there!  Thank you for your interest in helping out with 
FFI::Platypus!

I usually track TODO items in the project's GitHub repository's issue 
tracker.  Feel free to browse through that and tack a whack at 
implmenting a new feature or fixing an old bug.  You can let me know 
that you are working on it by commenting on the issue in question so 
that I can help coordinate the effort.

Documentation could always be improved, if something is confusing then 
feel free to re-write the confusing bits to be less so.  Also grammar 
and spelling are not my strengths so if you are an English major then 
you can probably help a lot.

If you are still not sure how you can help then feel free to email me.

  - moved cast and sizeof from FFI::Platypus::Memory
    into FFI::Platypus methods.
  - cast and size of functions for FFI::Platypus::Declare
  - attach_cast for faster casting
  - renamed FFI::Platypus::Declare#function to
    FFI::Platypus::Declare#attach to more closely match
    the OO interface

  - closure data now free'd when it the closure
    goes out of scope (GH#4)
